*** Definitions ***************************************************************

Page size in bytes

    The number of bytes in a single page of the database file.  
    Usually 1024.

Number of pages in the whole file

    The number of pages that go into forming the complete
    database

Pages that store data

    The number of pages that store data, either as primary B*Tree pages or
    as overflow pages.  The number at the right is the data pages divided by
    the total number of pages in the file.

Pages on the freelist

    The number of pages that are not currently in use but are reserved for
    future use.  The percentage at the right is the number of freelist pages
    divided by the total number of pages in the file.

Pages of auto-vacuum overhead

    The number of pages that store data used by the database to facilitate
    auto-vacuum. This is zero for databases that do not support auto-vacuum.

Number of tables in the database

    The number of tables in the database, including the SQLITE_MASTER table
    used to store schema information.

Number of indices

    The total number of indices in the database.

Number of defined indices

    The number of indices created using an explicit CREATE INDEX statement.

Number of implied indices

    The number of indices used to implement PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints
    on tables.

Size of the file in bytes

    The total amount of disk space used by the entire database files.

Bytes of user payload stored

    The total number of bytes of user payload stored in the database. The
    schema information in the SQLITE_MASTER table is not counted when
    computing this number.  The percentage at the right shows the payload
    divided by the total file size.

Percentage of total database

    The amount of the complete database file that is devoted to storing
    information described by this category.

Number of entries

    The total number of B-Tree key/value pairs stored under this category.

Bytes of storage consumed

    The total amount of disk space required to store all B-Tree entries
    under this category.  The is the total number of pages used times
    the pages size.

Bytes of payload

    The amount of payload stored under this category.  Payload is the data
    part of table entries and the key part of index entries.  The percentage
    at the right is the bytes of payload divided by the bytes of storage 
    consumed.

Average payload per entry

    The average amount of payload on each entry.  This is just the bytes of
    payload divided by the number of entries.

Average unused bytes per entry

    The average amount of free space remaining on all pages under this
    category on a per-entry basis.  This is the number of unused bytes on
    all pages divided by the number of entries.

Non-sequential pages

    The number of pages in the table or index that are out of sequence.
    Many filesystems are optimized for sequential file access so a small
    number of non-sequential pages might result in faster queries,
    especially for larger database files that do not fit in the disk cache.
    Note that after running VACUUM, the root page of each table or index is
    at the beginning of the database file and all other pages are in a
    separate part of the database file, resulting in a single non-
    sequential page.

Maximum payload per entry

    The largest payload size of any entry.

Entries that use overflow

    The number of entries that user one or more overflow pages.

Total pages used

    This is the number of pages used to hold all information in the current
    category.  This is the sum of index, primary, and overflow pages.

Index pages used

    This is the number of pages in a table B-tree that hold only key (rowid)
    information and no data.

Primary pages used

    This is the number of B-tree pages that hold both key and data.

Overflow pages used

    The total number of overflow pages used for this category.

Unused bytes on index pages

    The total number of bytes of unused space on all index pages.  The
    percentage at the right is the number of unused bytes divided by the
    total number of bytes on index pages.

Unused bytes on primary pages

    The total number of bytes of unused space on all primary pages.  The
    percentage at the right is the number of unused bytes divided by the
    total number of bytes on primary pages.

Unused bytes on overflow pages

    The total number of bytes of unused space on all overflow pages.  The
    percentage at the right is the number of unused bytes divided by the
    total number of bytes on overflow pages.

Unused bytes on all pages

    The total number of bytes of unused space on all primary and overflow 
    pages.  The percentage at the right is the number of unused bytes 
    divided by the total number of bytes.
